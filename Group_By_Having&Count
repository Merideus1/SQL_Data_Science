# Let's use the table to see which comments generated the most replies. Since:

# the parent column indicates the comment that was replied to, and
# the id column has the unique ID used to identify each comment,
# we can GROUP BY the parent column and COUNT() the id column in order to figure out the number of comments that were made as responses to a specific comment. 
# (This might not make sense immediately -- take your time here to ensure that everything is clear!)

# Furthermore, since we're only interested in popular comments, we'll look at comments with more than ten replies. So, we'll only return groups HAVING more than ten ID's.

# Query to select comments that received more than 10 replies
